## Creating Content

Pico is a flat file CMS. This means there is no administration backend or
database to deal with. You simply create `.md` files in the `content` folder
and those files become your pages. For example, this file is called `index.md`
and is shown as the main landing page.

When you install Pico, it comes with some sample contents that will display
until you add your own content. Simply add some `.md` files to your `content`
folder in Pico's root directory. No configuration is required, Pico will
automatically use the `content` folder as soon as you create your own
`index.md`. Just check out [Pico's sample contents][SampleContents] for an
example!
